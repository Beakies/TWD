This protocol is intended to be used for the mid-Gully. It specifies general beaked whale event detection followed by species-specific validation-level discrimination for Ha, Mb, and Zc. Validation-level criteria for Ha and Mb are fairly liberal, while Cuvier's emphasize precision due the large overlap with the ubiquitous NBW clicks.

True's/Gervais' are not included due to their apparent rarity (no clicks from these species have been detected in the Gully) and non-negligable overlap in click properties with NBWs and Sowerby's. Including an Mm/Me detector for the Gully would increase false positive rate more than anything.
