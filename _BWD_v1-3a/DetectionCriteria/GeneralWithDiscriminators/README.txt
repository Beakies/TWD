This is a variation on the "General" protocol. Implements general beaked whale discrimination at both the event-level and validation-level, but additionally adds species-specific discriminators which may be used interactively during validation.

Best used outside the Gully.

The idea for this is to be able to view all clicks that meet the general, validation-level criteria (which is the most general), but also be able to apply the species-specific criteria interactively to assist with vieweing and classifying events.
