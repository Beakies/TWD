This protocol is experimental, used to investigate new criteria for better separating Cuviers from NBWs during
the validation stage. Only tries to detect Cuvier's, and event and validation criteria are the same.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
- Zc1: Highly effective at removing bad clicks and often gets good Zc, though might be a bit too aggressive. Try
expanding F0 lower bound by 1-2, and also EDur upper bound (say to 0.2). ICI plot is often useless, but wouldn't
be much better with tons of NBWs contaminating anyway...

- Zc2: getting a bit more crap, but not overwhelming. Maybe better ICIs.
Recall actually seems OK with this one. Maybe keep. Trying to improve may start to flood with NBWs.
