This protocol is used to create a dataset that will be used to tune parameters and assess detector performance for
the Gully situation. Event detection is effectively disabled (rigged to include every segment as an event), and
species-specific validation-level criteria are defined to help with manual examination of clicks in segments.

This approach is to be used as an alternative to PAMlab examination (or at least a complement to it). Due to the
sheer number of NBW clicks, and occasionally delphinid clicks, PAMlab analysis can also result in missed
detections, so it is not unreasonable to use BWD for this purpose too.
