This folder contains documentation for older versions of TWD/BWD/SWD. Some of it is still relevant in TWD v1.3, but not all. In particular, SWD did not exist in version 1.0, and neither did the TWD framework - at the time, there was only BWD. The addition of SWD, which subsequently led to the transition from BWD only to TWD, occurred with version 1.2. Unfortunately, BWD 1.0 had by far the most complete documentation; updated user manuals for TWD 1.2 were not provided apart from a basic changelog and simple instructions for using SWD.

For TWD version 1.3, the technical document should be the main reference.
